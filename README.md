## Deliverables
The following deliverables are mandatory.

### Source code
Source code, Arduino C, JS or Python, committed to (this) project repo.

[Arduino](02-Arduino/01_ESP8266_remote_Client_demo/01_ESP8266_remote_Client_demo.ino)

[Sonos Api](03-Raspberrypi/readme.md)

... (adapt as required)

2) Glue Code used on the gateway or "in the cloud".
3) App or Web UI code, or IoT platform setup steps.

### Presentation
4-slide presentation, PDF format, committed to (this) project repo.

[IoT_Praesentation_Slides.pdf](05-Praesentation-Slides/IoT_Praesentation_Slides.pdf)

1) Use-case of your project.
2) Reference model of your project.
3) Single slide interface documentation.
4) Issues you faced, how you solved them.

### Live demo
Working end-to-end prototype, "device to cloud", part of your 10' presentation.

1) Sensor input on a IoT device triggers an event.
2) The event or measurement shows up online, in an app or Web client.
3) The event triggers actuator output on the same or on a separate IoT device.

## Submission deadline
